Hello! I'm Ashwan Shrestha, a passionate MERN Stack Developer with a strong foundation in building modern, scalable web applications. I specialize in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, leveraging these technologies to create efficient and user-friendly solutions.

When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my two biggest passions: programming and football. I enjoy tackling new coding challenges, exploring emerging technologies, and contributing to open-source projects. On the field, I love the teamwork, strategy, and excitement that football brings.

I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and connect with like-minded professionals. Feel free to reach out to me at ashwanshrestha07@gmail.comâ€”I'd love to hear from you!

Looking forward to new opportunities and meaningful connections. ðŸš€
